# assettoCorsaCarListExport

Scans all of your Assetto Corsa cars and tracks and outputs spreadsheets with all of the information about the cars. 

#HOW TO USE#

- Put all of the extracted files from this repository into your assetto corsa content folder.
- Get Python (if you don't have it)!   ( I recommend using anaconda 3 for development) but any install of python version 3 should work...
- You can get Python HERE: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/ 
- you can even get it from microsoft store, and you probably already have it and don't know it..  
- Determine where the installed python.exe is - and copy that full filepath into your clipboard.
- Edit the RUN_THIS.BAT File with notepad or text editor of your choice 
- You have to SET THE PYTHON PATH IN THE RUN_THIS.BAT File! This is the full filepath to your python.exe file
- Paste the full filepath into the BAT file after PYTHONPATH= 
- Then... RUN THE RUN_THIS.BAT FILE

The spreadsheet files will be generated into your content folder. 

*That's it!*
